# BlockchainSupplyChain

This project demonstrates a blockchain-based supply chain system. It tracks the movement of products from suppliers to manufacturers, distributors, and retailers using blockchain technology. This project is designed to ensure transparency and traceability within the supply chain.

## Project Description

The Supply Chain Blockchain system leverages blockchain to provide real-time, transparent tracking of products as they move from one stage to the next, from Supplier -> Manufacturer -> Distributor -> Retailer. The blockchain ensures data integrity by using cryptographic hashes for each block, and the system allows for temperature monitoring at each stage of the product's journey.

Key features of the project:
- Blockchain-based supply chain tracking
- Temperature monitoring for products
- Transparent and immutable data logs
- Easy to use and extend for various supply chain scenarios

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language for the project.
- **Eclipse IDE**: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for development.
- **Git**: Version control for managing project code.
- **Blockchain**: Basic blockchain implementation to simulate supply chain operations.
